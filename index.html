<section><h2><span style="border: 1px solid black">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>I live with my dad in the Southside of Chicago. I grew up there, 
so if I were to move to a quieter place, I don't feel like it would
be the same. I have four siblings in total; my older sister, my older 
brother, and my two younger brothers. My mom and dad were both born 
and raised in Mexico. They both came to the U.S. when they were very young--
an incredible feat. The people that I would say I admire the most 
would be my parents becuase they have worked extremely hard their whole 
life. Personally, I have never been to Mexico, but I would like to travel 
there someday to feel more connected with my culture. I am currently
a computer science major, and I'm leaning towards videogame programming. 
(I just think videogames are really cool and I have a couple ideas 
that I would want to see out).</p>

    <h2><span style="border: 1px solid black">What I Hope to 
        Learn in This Course
</span></h2>
    <p>I hope to learn how to pay attention to finer details
and to be okay with making mistakes. I also would like to be able 
to finish this course with a good understanding on how to work towards a
goal until it is satisfied. A big part that I would like to improve 
on would be communication, and since we are placed in scrum teams, 
I hope I can improve on that aspect.</p>

<section><h2><span style="border: 1px solid black">My Fovorite Hobby</span></h2>
<p>I would say that my favorite hobby is either drawing/sketching
or writing. I like to write whatever comes to my mind--whether it's
a character and their background, or even a moment in time with no 
specific protagonist so that it's simply a narration. The same thing 
can be said for when I draw. I'm not very good at it, but I am trying to 
improve through practice. I've recently bought a few new notebooks and 
sketchbookds, so hopefully that will be enough motivation.</p>

<h2><span style="border: 1px solid black">Fun Fact!</span></h2>
    <p>I've recently started learning how to play the piano--though I
         haven't really made much progress. My brother has been
trying to teach me how to play <i>For Elise</i> and I only have a small
section memorized.</p>

<p>Another fun fact about me...During a creative writing course that I took 
    in high school, we had the option of doing an independent work study, 
    and I chose it on a topic that my partner and I were both interested in.
    We actually ended up making a webpage on it, and it can be found here:
